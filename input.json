Preparation of ZnO nanoparticles

In the process of synthesis, zinc acetate (0.1 M) was used as a precursor in this study. Zinc acetate was freshly prepared and then used for metal ions reduction from Zn2+ into Zn ions. 10 ml extract of soybean seed was blended with 90 ml of zinc acetate solution and maintained at 60 Â°C for 10 min followed by overnight incubation. Reduction of zinc acetate was monitored by a visual color change.
The FESEM and EDAX were done to assess the morphology and purity of formed ZnONPs. Fig. 2 shows the FESEM of manufactured ZnONPs. FESEM images were seen in a different range of magnification ranging from 200 nm to 500 nm, which visibly validated the occurrence of sphere-shaped ZnONPs with a mean diameter of 12 nm obtained by the biosynthesis process. FESEM in combination with EDAX confirmed the synthesis of the oxide form of ZnONPs. Appearance of oxygen in the analysis confirms the construction of ZnONPs. The Fig. 3 depicts the graph of the EDAX of synthesized nanoparticles.
